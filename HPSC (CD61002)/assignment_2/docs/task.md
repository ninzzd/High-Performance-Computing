# Assignment 2 
Consider a square domain of unit size in which Laplacian (T)=0 has to be solved. The bottom, right and left boundaries are at constant T=0, where as the upper boundary has constant T=1. Generate structured FDM mesh with dx, dy=0.08, 0.04 and 0.02 . Obtain the respective coefficient matrices A for Laplace equation and substitute the boundary conditions. Is this a symmetric matrix? If not, then replace A with 1/2[A+A(transpose)]. Solve the resulting Ax=b problem for each grid using SOR (optimum), Steepest descent, MR, CG and BICGSTAB. Report number of iterations for same convergence and computing time.
